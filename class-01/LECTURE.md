# Class 01

Fundamentals of Software Development

## Canvas / Github

Canvas: learning management system, submit all work here.

* 3 things to turn everyday: readings, lab, learning journals.
* Once a week: partner power reports, career coaching assignments.
* 4 review quizzes to help prep for the entrance exam.

Github: Source of all code and instructions for a given class module.

## Our Development Environment

* Terminal / Command Prompt. Allows us programmatic access to our file system. Allows us to run programs using text.

* Web browser. All the code that we formally use will run here.  HTML / CSS / JS all run and do things here in the browser.

## DEMO

### Terminal Commands

`ls` - READ all files and folders at the current directory (or specified folder)
`mkdir` - CREATE a folder at the current directory.
`touch` - CREATE a file at the current directory.
`rm` - DELETEs a file (use `-r` to remove folders and their contents).
`mv` - UPDATE your file system, by either moving a file to a new directory. Often used to rename a file.
`cd` - Change the location of our terminal current working directory.

### HTML / CSS / JSS

Web Applications with our 3 favorite languages.

HTML - structure / content.

CSS - style / look / feel / appearance

JS - action / behavior / interactions from a user.
